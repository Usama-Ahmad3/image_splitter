  },
)
```

### Complete Example

```dart
class ImageSplitterDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  State<ImageSplitterDemo> createState() => _ImageSplitterDemoState();
}

class _ImageSplitterDemoState extends State<ImageSplitterDemo> {
  File? imageFile;
  ImageSplitterController? splitterController;

  Future<void> pickImage() async {
    final picker = ImagePicker();
    final pickedFile = await picker.pickImage(source: ImageSource.gallery);
    
    if (pickedFile != null) {
      setState(() {
        imageFile = File(pickedFile.path);
      });
    }
  }

  Future<void> splitImage() async {
    if (splitterController != null && imageFile != null) {
      try {
        final splitImages = await splitterController!.splitImage(imageFile!);
        // Use the split images as needed
        print('Successfully split into ${splitImages.length} images');
      } catch (e) {
        print('Error splitting image: $e');
      }
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Column(
        children: [
          if (imageFile == null)
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: pickImage,
              child: Text('Pick Image'),
            )
          else
            Expanded(
              child: ImageSplitter(
                image: imageFile!,
                crossAxisCount: 3,
                rowCount: 3,
                onControllerReady: (controller) {
                  splitterController = controller;
                },
              ),
            ),
          if (imageFile != null)
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: splitImage,
              child: Text('Split Image'),
